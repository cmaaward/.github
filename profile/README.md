Every year, over 6,000 members of the Country Music Association come together to determine which artists should take home the top awards, like entertainer of the year, album of the year and female and male vocalists of the year, according to the CMA Awards' website. 

For the 2024 ceremony, Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, Morgan Wallen and Lainey Wilson will battle it out to see who will be named entertainer of the year. Combs, Stapleton and Jelly Roll also join Kacey Musgraves and Cody Johnson in the album of the year category. The full list of nominees who are hoping to snag a coveted crystal CMA trophy can be found here. 

Stapleton is expected to be highlighted throughout the night as he will open the ceremony performing with Post Malone. The duo recently collaborated on a song on Malone’s “F-1 Trillion” country album, which was released in August, called “California Sober.” 

There will also be a tribute to honor George Strait, who is being presented with the CMA Willie Nelson Lifetime Achieve Award, per the CMA Awards' website.

To present these awards and others during the show, the CMA Awards have tapped Simone Biles, Jeff Bridges, Freddie Freeman, Don Johnson, Little Big Town, Billy Bob Thornton and more stars.
